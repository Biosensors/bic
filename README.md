Biosensors Inventory Consolidator
This program is used by the warehouse at BBV in order to proceed with the yearend stock counts. It works with the help of the Motorola CS 3070 scanners (same as for other programs performing products counts). However, other devices might be used as well.
How to use it
The users open the BIC program from the Windows Orb. Should they not have it installed, they can find the latest version at: \\bbvfs01.bbv.bsi.corp\Software\Biosensors\WarehouseCounter
